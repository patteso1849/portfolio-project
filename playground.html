    <!--Generally, you should only have one <h1> per page.
      Keep your heading tags 'in order.''
      NEVER you heading tags just to 'style' your test-->
    <h1>This is a header</h1>
    <h2>This is an even smaller header</h2>
    <h3>Even smaller...</h3>
    <p>Here is some normal text. A paragraph, even!</p>
    <p><em>This is an 'emphasis' tag that will usually render italicized.</em></p>

    <p><i>this text is italicized. We don't typically use this tag any longer. However, we would use it when we want to italicized with out additional emphasis</i></p>
    <p><b>This text is in bold.</b></p>
    <p><b><i>This text is in both.</i></b></p>
    <p><del>This text is rendered with strikethrough.</del></p>
    <p>Sometimes you want to embed some <i>stylized text</i> right into <b>your paragraph.</b> Pretty cool, right!</p>
    <p>You could BREAK
      <!--You should only use the <br> tag when th line break is actually apart the content, such as in a mailing address or in a poem-->
      <!--<address> tag is not just for mailing addresses. Its anything that's considered information for the author of the page. -->
      <address>

      </address>
      <br> the line, but it's not used very often these days.</p>
