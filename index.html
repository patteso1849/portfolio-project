    <p>Journalists are getting assaulted to get the story. Benjamin Jacobs of the Guardian gets body slammed and punched by literal anus Greg Gianforte.

      <p>After Jacobs asks Gianforte about the new health care bill, the conversation went delightfully like this,</p>

      <p>GREG GIANFORTE (horny to assault some journalist, or a gaggle of them. So sumptuous in his gross face):</p>
      <p>"Speak with Shane, please."</p>

      <p>BEN JACOBS (desiring so intensely to be punched) -</p>
      <p>"But you don't..."</p>
      (The sound of Gianfranco ejaculating and choke masturbation slamming a journalist)

      <p>GIANFORTE- "Just - I'm sick and tired of you guys. The last guy that came in here - you did the same thing. Get the hell out of here."</p>

      <p>Gianforte is a true mans manâ€™s man butt, not only winning the house seat, but just to show America that real men get real women Gianfranco will be wed to Ms. Demeanor.</p>

      <p>In closing, imagine your world crumbling as the supposed swamp is being filled with criminals.
