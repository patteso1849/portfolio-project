        <h2>Man Goo</h2>
        <p>The apartment was littered with books and towels. From one of those cum ridden goo cloths was birthed a child. He erupted from the laundry been a fully formed baby man. When his single father arrived home he was flabbergasted. <br>
          "A child, in this my home."<br>
          For a second he thought that someone must have broken in and left a baby in my apartment. But there were no signs of forced entry. And who the fuck just leaves a random ass baby in someones house. He then realized that the child was birthed from one of his jack off towels drenched in his man goo.
          <p>Finally there was proof of the Antiabortion activists claim of life. Anything the seiman touches will become a baby. The gestation is a few weeks. Masturbation must be made illegal!</p>
